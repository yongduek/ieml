# numpy intro

## Key Examples

- All of the following problems are found in the text book. 
- Try to answer the questions by searching for appropriate `numpy` functions. 
- Use jupyter notebook

## 1. What is the average height of US presidents?
  * `02.04 Computation on arrays & aggregates.ipynb`
  - plot a graph of the heights for visual display through time
  - plot a histogram of the heights to examine the distribution of heights
  - Write a python script to find
    1. the tallest president
    2. the shorted president
    3. the average of the heights
    4. the median of the heghts
    
 * count the alphabets used in the names, and plot the histogram.
    - based on the count, compute the score for each of them
    - who has the hightest score?
    - where can you get the height data for vice-presidents? Then, explore the height difference between president and vice president.
 
## 2. Counting Rainy Days
  * `02.06 Boolean Arrays and Masks.ipynb`
  - Plot histogram
  - How many days of having rain?
    - Try to use boolean operation to get masks for readable and faster computation.
  - Count the number of no rainy days.

## 3. Binning Data - Histogram making algorithm
  - `02.07-Fancy-Indexing.ipynb`
  - principle of histogram making for continuous variables vs discrete variables
  - understand the i/o of `np.searchsorted()`
    - binary tree search vs linear search
  - define arrays of `bins` and `counts`
  - write a python code of your own to compute the histogram using `np.searchsorted()`
    - Note: Do not use `np.add.at()`, which is shown in the book.
  - plot the histogram with `matplotlib`
