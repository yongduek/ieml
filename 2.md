# The 2nd

Plan: Python Programming Revisited

This class will try to revise python programming. The class has only 1 hour 15 minutes. You may try at home and come back later if you have a problem in solving or any question.

Remember! Mistakes and errors should be welcomed since it will help you understand the language better.

## Reference: 
- Basic: https://www.learnpython.org/
- File I/O: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_write.asp

## Python basics: 
- try www.learnpython.org to get acquinted with basic python programming
- basic data types: str, int, float, list, dict, tuple, set, bool

## General programming exercise:
    - www.jungol.co.kr
    - www.spoj.com

## Go through www.learnpython.org
- interactively learn python programming
- Run each code in your computer
    - use `vscode`, `pycharm`, `spider`, etc
        
- reading console input in `str` type
```
s = input()
print (s, type(s))
```
The input `s` is a `str` data. If the input is `10 20`, then `a, b = s.split()` will split `s` into two strings of numbers. Then their integer data can be obtained:
```
    a, b = s.split()
    print (a, type(a))
    a = int(a)
    print (a, type(a))
``` 

Now you can try various problems in the web-sites of general programming exercise.  If you know Korean, then www.jungol.co.kr is a good place to start at.

For example, the problem at http://jungol.co.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=pbank&wr_id=11&sca=1030 asks you to make a computer program in one of C/C++/Java/Python2/Python3:
```
네 숫자의 총합과 평균을 구하시오 (평균의 소수점 이하는 버림한다.)
입력예
70 95 63 100
출력예
sum 328
avg 82
```
A solution to this problem in python 3 could be as follows:
```
s = input()
a,b,c,d = s.split()
a = int(a)
b = int(b)
c = int(c)
d = int(c)
total = a + b + c + d
avg = total / 4.
avg = int(avg)
print ('sum ', total)
print ('avg ', avg)
```
Of course, this is an illustration. You can use every python technique so that the above code may look more fancy and sophisticated. However, as long as the output conforms to the one required by the problem, it is OK.


END.
