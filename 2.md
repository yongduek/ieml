# The 2nd

Plan: Python Programming Revisited

## Reference: 
- Basic: https://www.learnpython.org/
- File I/O: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_write.asp

## Python basics: 
- try www.learnpython.org to get acquinted with basic python programming
- basic data types: str, int, float, list, dict, tuple, set, bool

## General programming exercise:
    - www.jungol.co.kr
    - www.spoj.com

## Go through www.learnpython.org
- interactively learn python programming
- Run each code in your computer
    - use `vscode`, `pycharm`, `spider`, etc
        
- reading console input in `str` type
```
s = input()
print (s, type(s))
```
The input `s` is a `str` data. If the input is `10 20`, then `a, b = s.split()` will split `s` into two strings of numbers. Then their integer data can be obtained:
```
a, b = s.split()
print (a, type(a))
a = int(a)
print (a, type(a))
```
Now you can try various problems in the web-sites of general programming exercise. 
If you know Korean, then www.jungol.co.kr is a good place to start at.

For example, the problem at http://jungol.co.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=pbank&wr_id=11&sca=1030 asks you to make a computer program in one of C/C++/Java/Python2/Python3:
```
네 숫자의 총합과 평균을 구하시오 (평균의 소수점 이하는 버림한다.)
입력예
70 95 63 100
출력예
sum 328
avg 82
```
