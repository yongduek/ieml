    - examine the distribution of the data
    
2. What is your answer for the following question?

    **Question:** 
    1. Write your own method to separate `Iris-setosa` from others?
        - Explain Verbally & Visually. You don't have to be mathematical!
        - Make a rule based on your (magnified) inspection on the visualization of the data distribution.
    1. What is your idea of separating out 'Iris-verginica' from others?
    1. Write down the rules of your invention. Enumerate the the rules sequentially.
