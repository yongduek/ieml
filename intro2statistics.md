# Introduction to Statistics: Frequentist and Bayesian

0. Show an AP Problem by Sal Khan to introduce a statistics problem.
1. PMF, CDF, PDF
    1. Bernoulli Distribution
    1. Binomail Distribution
    1. Normal Distribution
    1. numpy, scipy, matplotlib, altair, pandas
    
2. A Typical Frequentist Approach  : Just focus on z-test. Other parts may be taken by themselves.
    - N times Repeated Bernoulli is Binomail
    - When N is large, Binomail is very much similar to Normal
    - Try to give a solution to the problem with Binomial Model
    - Try to use Normal approximation to give a solution. 
    - $z$-test or $t$-test

3. A Bayesian Approach
    - what is is?

4. Regression
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression

    - python
    - practical application examples are impressive
    - computation needs to be explained during the lecture
    - encourge students to make python codes by themselves instead of using the library
