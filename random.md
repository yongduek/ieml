# Random Sampling and Standard Distributions

## 1. check the functions in `numpy.random`
  - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.16.0/reference/routines.random.html
  - https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/random/index.html
  
## 2. plot histograms
  1. 1M samples generated from N(0,1)
  2. 1M samples from U(0,1)
  3. 1M discrete samples from U(0,1000) using 'np.randint()'
  4. 1M samples from Bernoulli distribution with $P(X=1) = 0.3$
    - the samples composed of two things normally denoted as 0 and 1 (or A and B)
  5. 1M trials from binomial distribution with $n=100$ trials and the probability of success $p = 0.3$
