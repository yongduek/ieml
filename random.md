# Random Sampling and Standard Distributions

## 1. check the functions in `numpy.random`
  - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.16.0/reference/routines.random.html
  - https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/random/index.html
  
## 2. plot histograms
  1. 1M samples generated from N(0,1)
  2. 1M samples from U(0,1)
  3. 1M discrete samples from U(0,1000) using 'np.randint()'
  4. 1M samples from Bernoulli distribution with ```$P(X=1) = 0.3$```
    - the samples composed of two things normally denoted as 0 and 1 (or A and B)
  5. 1M trials from binomial distribution with `$$n=100$$` trials and the probability of success `$$p = 0.3$$`
  
  
## 3. CDF (Cumulative distribution function), PDF (Prob. distribution function), PMF (Prob. Mass Function)
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function
  
  1. plot cdf and pdf of Normal (or Gaussian) distribution with (`$$mean=0$$`, `$$\sigma=1$$`) and (`$mean=0$`, `$\sigma=5$`), respectively.
  2. plot cdf and pdf of uniform distribution `$U[0,1]$`
  3. plot cdf and pmf of Bernoulli distribution with `$p=0.3$`
  4. plot cdf and pmf of `$binomial(n=100, p=0.3)$`
